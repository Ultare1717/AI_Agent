# AI Query Agent

This repository contains a Python script that sets up an interactive query agent using the `llama_index` library. The agent can query various data sources, including a population dataset and detailed information about Canada. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to process and respond to user queries.

## Features

- Load and query a population dataset.
- Integrate with a custom note engine for additional querying capabilities.
- Access detailed information about Canada from a PDF document sourced from Wikipedia.
- Interactive command-line interface to input queries and receive responses.
- Utilizes `ReActAgent` from `llama_index` for reactive interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager
